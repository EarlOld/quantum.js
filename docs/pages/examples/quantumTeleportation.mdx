
# Example: Quantum Teleportation

This example demonstrates how to create a quantum circuit that performs quantum teleportation using the `Circuit` class. Quantum teleportation allows the transfer of quantum information from one qubit to another without physically transferring the qubit itself.

The code snippet below creates a quantum circuit with 3 qubits and applies the quantum teleportation protocol to teleport the state of the first qubit to the third qubit.

```typescript
import { Circuit } from '@earlold/quantum.js';

const circuit = new Circuit(3);
Circuit.teleportationOneToThree(circuit);
circuit.print();
```

### Code Explanation

1. **Importing the Circuit Class:**
   ```typescript
   import { Circuit } from '@earlold/quantum.js';
   ```
   This line imports the `Circuit` class from the `Circuit` module, which provides the necessary functionality to create and manipulate quantum circuits.

2. **Creating a Quantum Circuit:**
   ```typescript
   const circuit = new Circuit(3);
   ```
   This line initializes a new quantum circuit with 3 qubits. The number `3` specifies the number of qubits in the circuit.

3. **Applying the Quantum Teleportation Protocol:**
   ```typescript
   Circuit.teleportationOneToThree(circuit);
   ```
   This static method on the `Circuit` class applies the quantum teleportation protocol to the circuit, teleporting the state of the first qubit (qubit 0) to the third qubit (qubit 2).

4. **Printing the Circuit:**
   ```typescript
   circuit.print();
   ```
   This method prints the current state of the circuit, allowing you to visualize the quantum gates and their positions on the qubits.

### Quantum Teleportation Protocol

The quantum teleportation protocol involves the following steps:
1. **Entanglement Creation:** Create an entangled pair of qubits (qubits 1 and 2).
2. **Bell State Measurement:** Perform a Bell state measurement on qubits 0 and 1.
3. **Classical Communication:** Send the measurement results (classical bits) to the location of the third qubit.
4. **State Reconstruction:** Apply a corresponding quantum gate on qubit 2 based on the received classical bits to reconstruct the original state of qubit 0 on qubit 2.

The `Circuit.teleportationOneToThree` method encapsulates these steps, making it easy to perform quantum teleportation in your quantum circuits.

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { Circuit } from '@earlold/quantum.js';

const circuit = new Circuit(3);
Circuit.teleportationOneToThree(circuit);
circuit.print();
```

This example sets up a quantum teleportation circuit with 3 qubits and prints the resulting circuit configuration. The teleportation protocol transfers the state of the first qubit to the third qubit, demonstrating the power of quantum entanglement and classical communication.
